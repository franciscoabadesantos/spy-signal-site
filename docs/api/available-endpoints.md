# Available Frontend-Backend Integrations

Code is authoritative. This inventory records observed local routes and server helpers; verify the referenced implementation before changing a contract. Browser code should call local `/api/*` routes, while server helpers use `finance-backend` through `lib/backend.ts`.

Any pull request that creates, removes, or changes a route or its observable contract must update this inventory in the same diff. Unknown or unconfirmed behavior stays explicitly marked as such.

## Local route handlers

| Method and route | Purpose / consumer | Auth | Confirmed contract and errors | Relevant files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/tickers/index` | Sole runtime source for ticker autocomplete | Public browser route; shared secret and optional CF Access upstream | `TickerIndexPayload`; ETag/304; 502/503 error codes for backend configuration/access/availability | `app/api/tickers/index/route.ts`, `lib/ticker-search.ts`, `components/search/TickerSearchCombobox.tsx` |
| `POST /api/tickers/request` | Request ticker onboarding | Public; server authenticates upstream | Body `{ticker, region, exchange?}`; region `us|eu|apac`; backend failures may intentionally return 202 with status. Success shape is not fully confirmed here | `app/api/tickers/request/route.ts`, `lib/ticker-onboarding.ts` |
| `GET /api/tickers/status` | Poll onboarding status | Public; server authenticates upstream | Query `ticker`, `region`, `exchange?`; input 400; backend failures can return 200 status objects. Normal success beyond `status` is unknown | `app/api/tickers/status/route.ts`, `lib/ticker-onboarding.ts` |
| `GET /api/stocks/relationship-comparison` | Load recent price history for the two tickers selected in the Relationships comparison panel | Public ticker-page route; finance-backend credentials remain server-side | Query `base`, `peer`, `periodDays`; 400 for invalid/equal symbols, 502 when history is unavailable; success returns separate canonical history arrays for both tickers | `app/api/stocks/relationship-comparison/route.ts`, `lib/finance.ts`, `components/RelationshipComparisonChart.tsx` |
| `GET /api/network/atlas` | Load the community-level market universe without company nodes | Public browser route; finance-backend credentials remain server-side | Query `window=126|252`, `view=market|residual|timing|theme`; 502 when the materialized atlas is unavailable | `app/api/network/atlas/route.ts`, `lib/network.ts`, `components/MarketUniverse.tsx` |
| `GET /api/network/atlas/communities/:communityId` | Expand one market community into its bounded company graph | Public browser route; finance-backend credentials remain server-side | Query `window`, `view`, `limit`, optional `asOf=YYYY-MM-DD` to pin the overview snapshot; 400 invalid id/date, 502 unavailable; success is `RelationshipAtlasDetail` | `app/api/network/atlas/communities/[communityId]/route.ts`, `lib/network.ts`, `components/MarketUniverse.tsx` |
| `GET /api/network/atlas/neighborhoods/:ticker` | Load one ticker's bounded atlas neighborhood | Public browser route; finance-backend credentials remain server-side | Query `window`, `view`, `limit`, optional `asOf=YYYY-MM-DD` to pin the overview snapshot; 400 invalid ticker/date, 502 unavailable; success is `RelationshipAtlasDetail` | `app/api/network/atlas/neighborhoods/[ticker]/route.ts`, `lib/network.ts` |
| `POST`, `DELETE /api/watchlist` | Add/remove a ticker | Clerk user | Body `{ticker}`; success `{ok:true,ticker}`; 400/401/500/502 `{error}` | `app/api/watchlist/route.ts`, `components/WatchlistButton.tsx`, `lib/watchlist.ts` |
| `GET /api/export-signals?ticker=` | Download signal history CSV | Clerk user plus Pro plan | CSV success; 400/401/403/404/502 JSON error, 403 may include `upgradeUrl` | `app/api/export-signals/route.ts`, `lib/signals.ts`, `lib/types.ts` |
| `POST /api/models/validate` | Validate a single-stock model against history | No handler auth confirmed | Input based on `ModelDraftInput`; success `{model: ModelRecord}`; 400/422/500 `{error}` | `app/api/models/validate/route.ts`, `lib/model-builder.ts`, `lib/model-store-client.ts` |
| `POST /api/ai-analyst` | Stream Perplexity analysis | Public request; optional Clerk user for run persistence; server API key | Ticker/signal/news/question input; SSE stream plus `run_id`; 400/502/503 JSON before streaming. Perplexity request has no explicit local timeout | `app/api/ai-analyst/route.ts`, `components/AiAnalystPanel.tsx`, `lib/ai-research.ts` |
| `POST /api/ai-analyst/feedback` | Save research feedback | Clerk user | `{ticker, category, note?, runId?}`; `{ok:true}` or 400/401/500 `{error}` | `app/api/ai-analyst/feedback/route.ts`, `lib/ai-research.ts` |
| `POST /api/analytics/event` | Forward product analytics | Public; backend service auth | Input normalized in route; 400 invalid JSON. Missing backend and upstream failures intentionally fail open as 204 | `app/api/analytics/event/route.ts`, `lib/analytics.ts` |
| `GET /api/market/refresh` | Read/aggregate market data for requested tickers | Bearer token only when `MARKET_REFRESH_TOKEN` is configured | Query `tickers`, `periodDays`; 401 or `{ok,tickers,periodDays,refreshedAt,results}`. Current helper does not call a distinct backend refresh route | `app/api/market/refresh/route.ts`, `lib/finance.ts` |
| `GET /api/cron/check-signals` | Detect flips and send alert email | Bearer cron token when configured, falling back to refresh token | Query `date`, `dryRun=1`; response variants are defined in route, not a shared type | `app/api/cron/check-signals/route.ts`, `lib/alerts.ts`, `lib/watchlist.ts` |
| `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` | Activate Pro metadata after checkout | Stripe HMAC signature and timestamp tolerance | Handles `checkout.session.completed`; 400/500 `{error}`; success `{received,eventId}` | `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`, `lib/billing.ts` |

## Server-side backend paths

`lib/backend.ts` applies a default 9-second timeout, no-store by default, `x-backend-shared-secret`, and optional Cloudflare Access headers. The following paths are present in current helpers:

| Area | Observed paths | Types/consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tickers | `GET /tickers/index`, `/tickers/:ticker/summary`, `/profile`, `/scorecard`, `/history`, `/ohlc` | `lib/ticker-search.ts`, `ticker-data.ts`, `finance.ts`, `scorecard.ts`, `ohlc-data.ts` |
| Canonical ticker research | `GET /tickers/:ticker/financial-statements`, `/market-metrics`, `/events`, `/disclosures` | Server-only `lib/canonical-research.ts`; shared, audience-neutral ticker resources used by Financials, Valuation and Events. This server authenticates with the shared-secret boundary and never calls `/analyst/*` |
| Signals | `GET /signals/history/:ticker`, `/signals/last-flips`, `/signals/flips`, `/screener/signals` | `lib/signals.ts`, `lib/types.ts` |
| Market network | `GET /network`, `GET /relationships/:ticker`, `GET /network/atlas`, `GET /network/communities/:id`, `GET /network/neighborhoods/:ticker` | `lib/network.ts`, `lib/relationships.ts`; the progressive atlas is preferred by the global map. `/network` remains a temporary fail-open source that is collapsed server-side into community previews when atlas materialization is unavailable |
| Watchlists | `GET/POST/DELETE /site/watchlist`, plus `/all-tickers` and `/subscriptions` | `lib/watchlist.ts`, dashboard/server views |
| AI research | `POST/GET /site/ai-research/runs`, `GET/PATCH /runs/:id`, `POST /feedback` | `lib/ai-research.ts` |
| Alerts | `POST /site/alerts/reserve`, `/record` | `lib/alerts.ts` |
| Analytics | `POST /site/analytics/events` | local analytics route |

## Contract status

Contracts are handwritten TypeScript plus tolerant normalizers; there is no OpenAPI document, shared runtime schema, or generated client in this repository. Several upstream payloads enter as `unknown` and are normalized, while some are asserted directly. The request/status success payloads and some cron result variants are not fully specified here.

OpenAPI or generated types would be useful after `finance-backend` publishes a stable canonical schema and ownership/versioning are agreed. Adding generation now would create a second, potentially divergent source of truth. Prefer focused contract tests around existing high-risk routes in the meantime.
