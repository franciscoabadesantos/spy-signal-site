# Browser QA

## Setup

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run qa:browser
```

`qa:browser` first checks that the project Chromium executable exists, then delegates the full run to Playwright. `playwright.config.ts` starts the deterministic backend fixture, then the application server on the fixed internal URL `http://localhost:3100`, waits for readiness, pipes server logs, applies a startup timeout, and shuts both down. Locally it runs `npm run dev` with the isolated `.next-playwright` output directory; when `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER_MODE=production` is set it runs `npm run start` against the build already in `.next`. The isolated output avoids contention with a normal `.next/dev/lock`; Playwright does not silently reuse a process on the QA port. `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` is the explicit opt-in for an intentionally managed external server.

Do not start or stop a server manually, select another port, invoke Chromium directly, or repair browser locks during a QA run. The committed smoke test is deliberately content-light and checks homepage load, console/page errors, horizontal overflow, and deliberate screenshot capture across representative viewports.

`.github/workflows/frontend-qa.yml` runs the complete candidate check for browser/runtime paths. Its applicable job installs Chromium and calls the canonical command:

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run qa:frontend
```

The workflow does not reproduce the command's internal lint, typecheck, test, build, or Playwright steps. GitHub-connected Vercel—not Actions—creates the frontend Preview.

## Harness invariants

These are load-bearing. Each was learned from a failure that looked like an application bug.

- **`localhost` is the canonical frontend loopback origin.** The browser addresses the app server as `localhost`, and the app server does not pin a hostname. Next middleware normalizes loopback request origins to `localhost`, so pinning the server to `127.0.0.1` leaves the router comparing that against its literal init URL, misclassifying an internal rewrite as external and network-proxying the request back into itself. The visible symptom is a long stall ending in `Failed to proxy …`, `socket hang up` and `ECONNRESET` on routes that run middleware and then render. Never mix the two names for the application origin. The backend fixture is unaffected and stays on `127.0.0.1`, because nothing rewrites through it.
- **Candidate QA exercises the production runtime.** `qa:frontend` already builds, so Frontend QA sets `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER_MODE=production` and the browser suite runs against that build via `next start`, which is what Vercel serves. Local `qa:browser` still defaults to `next dev`. Do not let a green `next dev` run stand alone as release evidence for a runtime concern.
- **CI Clerk uses a dedicated Development instance.** Browser QA needs a publishable key wherever `clerkMiddleware()` runs, so the workflow supplies a disposable Clerk development application through a repository variable and secret, scoped to the single candidate-check step rather than the job or workflow. Never point CI at production credentials, and never commit key values.
- **Playwright `page.route()` cannot mock server-side fetching.** It intercepts browser requests only, so anything a server component or route handler fetches during render is out of reach. A page whose data is fetched server-side will render its empty or error state no matter what the browser mock returns.
- **Server-side backend dependencies use the local fixture backend.** `scripts/e2e-backend-stub.mjs` serves repository-owned synthetic data from `e2e/fixtures/`, and `playwright.config.ts` points `BACKEND_BASE_URL` at it. Paths the fixture does not model answer 503, matching what the application already sees when no backend is reachable. Fixture data is deliberately unmistakable and must never reach a production data path.

## Infrastructure blockers

- A missing package/browser binary, blocked loopback, or occupied QA port fails before server startup with a `[qa:browser:infra]` message and the direct remediation.
- Missing system libraries or a browser sandbox restriction should be reported from Playwright's launch error; do not replace the runner or add process-management workarounds.
- Server startup output is piped into the run. A readiness timeout or early server exit is a startup/infrastructure failure, not a browser assertion.
- Application failures retain traces, screenshots, and video under `test-results/`; report the assertion or runtime error separately from infrastructure failures.

## Visual and interaction pass

- Page and primary content load without uncaught errors, hydration warnings, failed essential resources, or unexpected console errors.
- No horizontal overflow, clipped text, overlapping UI, broken max-width, unstable hover sizing, or unintended layout shift.
- Alignment, hierarchy, line length, data formatting, image/canvas framing, and contrast remain coherent from small mobile to wide desktop.
- Navigation and mobile menu open, close, trap/release focus appropriately, restore focus, and respond to Escape and outside interaction when intended.
- All controls work with keyboard and have visible focus. Tab order follows the visual/task order; sticky content does not cover focus.
- Touch targets, scrolling, drag/pan alternatives, and input behavior work without hover dependence.
- Loading, empty, error, timeout, unauthorized, retry, partial, and stale states are exercised for changed integrations. Do not simulate only happy-path data.
- Reduced motion preserves content and state while removing smooth scroll, parallax, pinning, loops, and large travel as appropriate.

## Evidence and triage

Record route, commit/diff state, browser, viewport, steps, expected/actual, severity, console excerpt, and screenshot/trace path. Use traces or video for timing/scroll defects; avoid large baseline suites until a stable visual-review policy exists.

Minimum candidate evidence is limited to each affected route, its changed or important states, and representative required viewports from `viewport-matrix.md`; include applicable keyboard, touch, zoom, and reduced-motion behavior. Broaden evidence only when the changed surface or risk requires it.

Automated checks, screenshots, traces, and Preview evidence establish technical and review evidence only. They do not constitute visual, product, or release acceptance; the human approver records those decisions separately. Non-visual changes may mark Preview and visual acceptance not applicable with a reason.

Severity: `blocker` prevents the core task or exposes data/security; `high` breaks a major viewport/input/state; `medium` degrades comprehension or consistency; `low` is a bounded polish issue. Browser QA reports first and does not edit until Main assigns ownership.
