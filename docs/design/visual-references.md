# Visual References Log

External work is inspiration for principles, never a source to copy branding, layouts, copy, code, or assets. Record enough provenance to review rights and transformation.

## Current repository references

| Reference | Status | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/globals.css` and rendered components | Runtime source of truth | Tokens, utilities, responsive and interaction patterns |
| `design/direction-board.html` | Internal exploration | Directional comparison only |
| `design/hero-constellation-scroll.html` | Internal exploration | Related to the implemented homepage hero |
| `design/brand-navy-teal-system.html` | Internal exploration | Closest internal study of the current brand palette |
| Other `design/*.html` and `design/brand-tokens.css` | Historical/internal studies | Not canonical; verify against runtime before reuse |

## Runtime implementation exemplars

Study the rendered pattern, its responsive states, and its direct styling before extending it. These are implementation references, not components to copy wholesale.

| Pattern | Study | What to preserve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Marketing navigation and glass disclosure | `components/marketing/HeaderBar.tsx`, `components/marketing/SiteChromeMotion.tsx`, and the `.site-header*` rules in `app/globals.css` | One continuous surface, content hierarchy, CSS-owned morphing, open/close states, outside/Escape handling, and the desktop/mobile search transition |
| App navigation composition | `components/Nav.tsx`, `components/BrandHomeMenu.tsx`, and `components/marketing/site-chrome.tsx` | Active-state hierarchy, portal positioning, compact information density, and responsive search placement; treat it as a visual/compositional reference and re-check focus semantics for any new disclosure |
| Editorial typography and premium surfaces | `MarketingPageShell`, `SectionHeading`, and `GlassPanel` in `components/marketing/site-chrome.tsx` | Display/body contrast, constrained line length, asymmetric accent moments, layered highlights, and restrained use of glass rather than token-by-token imitation |
| Dense financial cards | `components/ScreenerSignalCard.tsx` with `components/ui/Card.tsx` and `components/ui/SignalBlock.tsx` | Label/value hierarchy, tabular numerals, signal redundancy, progressive density, and mobile readability |
| Responsive narrative motion | `components/marketing/HomeTickerStory.tsx` | Separate mobile/desktop geometry, transform/opacity animation, stable scroll reversal, and a meaningful reduced-motion final state |
| Complex hero motion | `components/marketing/HeroConstellation.tsx`, `components/motion/ScrollRuntime.tsx`, and `docs/design/motion-guidelines.md` | Singleton Lenis ownership, explicit page profiles, scoped GSAP scenes, cleanup, nonblank static content, and reduced-motion behavior |
| Focus and compact control states | `components/ui/Button.tsx`, `Input.tsx`, `SegmentedControl.tsx`, and `FilterChip.tsx` | Visible focus rings, state semantics, touch sizing, pressed/selected contrast, shared timing, and `motion-reduce` behavior |

There is not yet a repository-wide modal or drawer exemplar with a complete focus-management contract. Inspect current implementations for local context, but do not promote one to a shared pattern until focus entry, containment, Escape, backdrop behavior, and focus restoration are verified.

## Expanding selector study — 2026-07-21

The reusable expanding selector transforms mechanics from the references below into a Longbrunch-specific analytical control. It carries no ticker, investment-horizon, URL, or routing semantics. No reference code, assets, branding, or layout was copied.

| Reference | Source inspected | Principle retained | Rejected or replaced |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Glass Calendar](https://21st.dev/community/components/ravikatiyar/glass-calendar/default) | Rendered demo, registry component, demo source, and compiled CSS | Native horizontal overflow inside one glass vessel; touch-friendly item selection | Calendar composition, date state, and the absence of snap/radio semantics |
| [Expandable Tabs](https://21st.dev/community/components/victorwelander/expandable-tabs/default) | Rendered demo, component source, demo source, and compiled CSS | Compact-to-expanded disclosure and short label continuity | Conventional tab row, spring bounce, and button-only semantics |
| [Sliding Tabs](https://21st.dev/community/components/ruixen.ui/sliding-tabs) | Rendered demo, registry source, and demo source | Measured active geometry, `ResizeObserver`, keyboard model, and continuous indicator motion | A moving tab pill and permanently visible four-option layout |
| [Tubelight Navbar](https://21st.dev/community/components/ayushmxxn/tubelight-navbar/default) | Rendered demo, component source, and demo source | Restrained shared active-state continuity and responsive density | Navbar styling, icon substitution, and pronounced glow |
| [Liquid Weather Glass](https://21st.dev/community/components/ui-layouts/liquid-weather-glass/default), [Liquid Glass by Suraj](https://21st.dev/community/components/suraj-xd/liquid-glass), and [Liquid Glass by Pace](https://21st.dev/community/components/paceui/liquid-glass/default) | Rendered demos, registry/component source, demo source, and compiled CSS where exposed | Separate tint, highlight, edge, blur, and content layers | SVG displacement over text, global pointer followers, hidden cursors, elastic drag, and strong refraction |
| [Skewed Adjacent Hover Tabs](https://recent.design/i/nnkaerr-skewed-adjacent-hover-tabs) | Public demo description and rendered reference | Adjacent choices react with small opacity and scale changes | Skew and decorative hover choreography |
| [Mixing Horizontal and Vertical Scroll](https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/mixing-horizontal-and-vertical-scroll) and [Horizontal and Vertical Scroll](https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/horizontal-and-vertical-scroll) | Rendered inspiration pages and linked project context | Clipped continuation cues for local horizontal movement inside a stable vertical page | Page-level scroll hijacking and narrative scroll effects |

Longbrunch transformation: a stationary center window sits over a native snap viewport; real radio inputs remain the semantic source of truth; drag previews a controlled choice and the parent owns the committed state. Reduced motion removes smooth travel and scale transitions because none of the inspected implementations supplied a complete reduced-motion path.

## Ticker selected-node direction — 2026-08-03

| Reference | Principle retained | Rejected or replaced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User-provided ticker-page composition sketch | A selected colored node establishes identity before company name and price; a sparse relationship field connects the product page to the homepage topology | Exact spacing, typography, navigation geometry, chart styling, decorative density, and any implied third-party brand language |
| `components/marketing/HeroConstellation.tsx` | Focused-node projection, slow spatial drift, depth-based de-emphasis, separate blurred-background and sharp-connection passes, deterministic static reduced-motion state, and clear foreground/background separation | Homepage pinning, ScrollTrigger, Lenis ownership, node focus dialog, fabricated ticker values, and page-level scroll narrative |

Longbrunch transformation: the ticker hero uses a non-interactive, hero-local 3D Canvas field built from the relationship data already loaded for the page. The Canvas measures the semantic-color DOM node beside company identity and uses its exact center as the origin of every relevant edge. Relationship strength and confidence control sharp edge and endpoint prominence; unrelated points remain grey in a separately scaled and blurred depth layer. GSAP animates only the initial 550ms focus interpolation—there is no ticker-page ScrollTrigger, pinning, or Lenis instance. The field pauses offscreen and when the document is hidden, reduces density and relation count on mobile, and renders its final state without a loop under reduced motion. No external assets or code were copied.

## Shared scroll runtime — 2026-08-03

The homepage remains the motion reference, but its document-level mechanics now live in `components/motion/ScrollRuntime.tsx` and mount once from the root layout. Ordinary routes inherit `standard`, the app route group declares `operational`, and the homepage opts into `narrative`; only its constellation registers the pinned ScrollTrigger scene. Header and ticker-story observers subscribe to the same scroll channel. Motion tokens preserve the approved `0.1` Lenis interpolation, cinematic scrub, depth bands, and homepage distances. Document overscroll is contained, route navigation cancels residual inertia, and marked tables, menus, and local panels retain native nested scroll. Reduced motion deactivates Lenis and registered scenes while retaining native document flow and complete static content. Future pages must reuse the runtime, profile, lock, nested-scroll, and scene contracts rather than copying listeners or creating another smooth-scroll controller.

## Relationships observatory — 2026-08-03

The dedicated Relationships view extends the approved ticker selected-node language into an analytical instrument. It retains the semantic center node and deterministic topology, while sector color, relative raw strength, and a broader point field make the universe useful for discovery rather than decorative ranking. Canvas owns connection geometry and directional traces; accessible DOM buttons own node selection, focus and touch. Strength controls geometry and uses a nonlinear connection-weight curve; confidence controls resting clarity, while selection always restores focus. The selected company flows into a compact comparison lab with company name as the primary identity, two indexed-price paths overlaid in one frame with independent vertical scales, factual company context, and a separate navigation action; discovery cards expose the remaining active-layer companies. The saved expanding selector is a circular three-position reel: previous and next choices wrap around a legible selected view without resembling route navigation. A concise, persistent map key explains strength, confidence, sector color, and directional arrows. The canonical numeric evidence window uses the compact shared segmented toggle. `probableSpurious`, causal explanations, analysis/trading modes, named investment horizons, and invented lead/lag intervals remain visually unencoded until the backend supplies confirmed edge-level contracts.
