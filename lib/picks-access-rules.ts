 * data, and that is enforced in `lib/picks-access.ts`, which is server-only and is
 * the only caller of `cutToTier` that touches a real ranking.
 *
 * Keeping the arithmetic separate means the invariant that matters — a viewer never
 * receives more rows than their tier allows — is covered by a plain unit test instead
 * of resting on a component being written correctly.
